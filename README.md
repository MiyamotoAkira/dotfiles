Script to setup my system for development.

Based on Cyril's repo: https://github.com/cyplo/dotfiles

You need to have git already installed to download and use the scripts:

`sudo dnf -y install git`
or
`sudo apt-get -y install git`

Download the repo, get into the folder and execute

`fedora/up.sh`
or
`mint/up.sh`
