Script to setup my system for development.

Originally based on Cyril's repo: https://github.com/cyplo/dotfiles, now it has moved into using Ansible as the main way of deploying

# Requirements

You need to have git already installed to download and use the scripts:

`sudo dnf -y install git`
or
`sudo apt-get -y install git`

The other current requirement is that you are logged in as your user, and you have sudo permissions

# Use
Download the repo, get into the folder and execute
`fedora/up.sh`
or
`mint/up.sh`
